"""600 in-house forecast model for the 2026 U.S. midterms.

Pipeline per race:
  1. Fundamentals prior (D - R, two-party points): PVI at -1.0 (partisan lean
     maps ~1:1 onto margins, per FiftyPlusOne/Theo), plus a personal-vote
     term for running incumbents scaled by their track record (their last
     margin vs the seat's lean; zero for open seats, skipped when polls
     exist), blended with the last election result (70% for held seats, 40%
     for open seats — retiring/term-limited incumbents take their personal
     vote with them, so the structural PVI dominates).
  2. Rating band: the consensus of the three race ratings (Cook, Inside
     Elections, Sabato) as published on Wikipedia — the median rater's band
     with all three, the average with two — sets a direction + strength BAND
     (Safe >15, Likely 7.5-15, Lean 2.5-7.5, Tossup <2.5, per
     theoelections.com); the fundamentals prior is clamped inside that band
     so safe seats reach realistic extremes while competitive races stay
     competitive.
3. Polling blend (when a race has an aggregate/simple poll average):
     margin = 0.65 * poll_margin + 0.35 * prior_margin. Races with a serious
     independent on the ballot (Nebraska/Idaho/South Dakota/Montana Senate,
     Alaska's at-large House seat) skip the D-R prior entirely: their sides
     come straight from the poll shares, since the D-R rating bands do not
     describe them.
  4. National-swing Monte Carlo: every race shares a common environment
     shift S ~ N(env_weight * env_margin, sigma_n), where env_margin is the
     generic-ballot margin (D - R points), plus one per-state correlated
     deviation per night (sigma_state) so a state's Senate seat and House
     districts move together. env_weight is chamber-specific (0.25 for rated
     races, 1.0 for unrated; polls/ratings already embed the environment). A race is won by the side with the highest softmax
     probability softmax(share/beta) — for two sides this is exactly the
     previous logistic((margin + S)/beta). Races without a Democrat get the
     national shock only. Chamber seat tallies count Democrats, Republicans
     and independents separately across 20k simulated nights; independent
     wins are counted with the Democratic caucus (as the Senate independents
     caucus with them), so a party's majority probability includes them.
     Per-race win probabilities are reported at the swing mean.

Chamber majority thresholds: Senate 50 (current D-caucus 47 vs R 53),
House 218 seats, Governors shows an expected Dem/Rep count only.
